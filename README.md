# PROJECT-NETWORK
Our project aims to develop an advanced and comprehensive network topology for a cor-
porate entity, encompassing a campus infrastructure, data center facilities, DMZ (Demil-
itarized Zone) network segments, and integration with Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
The software we used is Gns3 , it’s a network software emulator first released in 2008 that
allows the combination of virtual and real devices, used to simulate complex networks. It
uses Dynamips emulation software to simulate Cisco IOS.

#  Second phase : Attack 
In the second phase of our project, the objective was to evaluate the security resilience of
the advanced network topology developed in the first phase by simulating insider attacks.
Unlike external penetration tests, insider attacks are conducted by individuals who already
have authorized access to the network, making them potentially more damaging and
harder to detect.
This phase involved a series of controlled insider attack scenarios designed to identify
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious insiders.
Understanding the impact of insider threats is critical for improving the overall security
posture of the corporate network. The insights gained from this phase are intended to
enhance the network’s defenses and ensure robust security measures are in place to protect
against potential insider threats.
